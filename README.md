# PrecisionBOM

AI-powered Bill of Materials (BOM) sourcing platform with blockchain-backed audit trails.

## Overview

PrecisionBOM automates electronic component sourcing through multi-agent AI systems. It combines real-time supplier data from DigiKey, Mouser, and Octopart with intelligent part recommendations and immutable record-keeping on Ethereum.

## Components

### [nextjs-app](./nextjs-app)
Next.js web application providing the user interface for BOM upload, part search, and sourcing workflows. Features authentication, real-time part lookups via DigiKey/Octopart APIs, and AI-powered suggestions.

### [python-agent](./python-agent)
Multi-agent BOM processing service built with CrewAI. Specialized agents (Engineering, Sourcing, Finance) evaluate components for compliance, supply chain risk, and budget constraints.

### [blockchain](./blockchain)
ERC-7827 smart contract implementation for immutable JSON state with version history. Provides forensic-grade audit trails for sourcing decisions and invoice records.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- pnpm or npm

### Web Application
```bash
cd nextjs-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Python Agent
```bash
cd python-agent
uv sync
uv run uvicorn bom_agent_service.main:app --reload
```

### Smart Contracts
```bash
cd blockchain
npm install
npx hardhat compile
```

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` files in each directory for required configuration:
- `nextjs-app/.env.example` - API keys, database, auth
- `python-agent/.env` - Anthropic API key

## Database

The application uses Neon Postgres. Configure `DATABASE_URL` in `nextjs-app/.env` with your Neon connection string.
