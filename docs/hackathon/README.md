## One-Liner

> **PrecisionBOM**: AI agents that turn a messy BOM into optimized sourcing strategies in minutes, not days.

## 30-Second Pitch

"Hardware engineers spend 40+ hours per project manually sourcing components. Supply chain volatility, compliance requirements, and budget constraints make this painful. PrecisionBOM uses a multi-agent AI system - Engineering, Sourcing, and Finance agents working in parallel - to analyze your BOM, search real-time inventory from DigiKey/Mouser/Octopart, and generate optimized sourcing strategies. We also create an immutable blockchain audit trail for regulated industries like medical devices. Built this weekend with CrewAI, FastAPI, and Next.js."
