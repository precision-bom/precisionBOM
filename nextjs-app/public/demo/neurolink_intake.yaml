    CRITICAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
    - Medical-grade neural signal acquisition device for research
    - Ultra-low noise power supplies required for analog front-end
    - Must use medical-grade connectors for patient contact
    - ESD protection mandatory on all patient-facing interfaces
    - ADS1299 is the heart of the system - NO SUBSTITUTES
    - STM32H7 required for real-time DSP capabilities
    - USB isolation required for patient safety (IEC 60601-1)
    - All precision resistors must be 0.1% or better

  critical_parts:
    - "U1"  # ADS1299 - Neural ADC, irreplaceable
    - "U2"  # STM32H7 - Main processor
    - "U3"  # Analog LDO - noise critical
    - "U5"  # Instrumentation amp
    - "U6"  # Digital isolator - patient safety
    - "J2"  # Medical connector - patient interface

  preferred_manufacturers:
    capacitors: ["Murata", "TDK", "KEMET"]
    resistors: ["Panasonic", "Vishay", "Yageo"]
    mcu: ["STMicroelectronics"]
    connectors: ["Harwin", "Amphenol", "Hirose"]

  avoid_parts:
    - mpn: "ADS1298"
      reason: "Insufficient channels - need full 8-channel ADS1299"
    - mpn: "STM32F4"
      reason: "Insufficient DSP performance for real-time neural processing"
