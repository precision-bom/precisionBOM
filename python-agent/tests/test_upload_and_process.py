"""Tests for BOM upload and processing flow.

Test Cases:
- UP1: Upload BOM and process
- UP2: Process creates trace entries
- UP3: Line items have status
- UP4: Re-process existing project
- UP5: Upload with intake file
- UP6: Upload minimal BOM

Note: These tests involve actual LLM calls and may take longer to run.
