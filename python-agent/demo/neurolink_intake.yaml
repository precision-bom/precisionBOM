    CRITICAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
    - This is a medical-grade neural signal acquisition device
    - Requires ultra-low noise power supplies for analog front-end
    - Must use medical-grade connectors for patient contact
    - ESD protection mandatory on all patient-facing interfaces
    - Prefer automotive/medical grade passives where available
    - ADS1299 is the heart of the system - no substitutes allowed
    - STM32H7 selected for DSP capabilities - must have 2MB+ flash
    - All analog components should be precision grade (0.1% or better for critical paths)
    - USB isolation required for patient safety (IEC 60601-1 compliance)

  critical_parts:
    - "U1"    # ADS1299 - Neural ADC, no substitutes
    - "U2"    # STM32H7 - Main processor
    - "U3"    # Analog LDO - critical for noise
    - "U5"    # Instrumentation amp - signal integrity
    - "U6"    # Digital isolator - patient safety
    - "J2"    # Medical connector - patient interface

  preferred_manufacturers:
    capacitors:
      - "Murata"
      - "TDK"
      - "KEMET"
    resistors:
      - "Panasonic"
      - "Vishay"
      - "Yageo"
    mcu:
      - "STMicroelectronics"
    connectors:
      - "Harwin"
      - "Amphenol"
      - "Hirose"

  avoid_parts:
    - mpn: "ADS1298"
      reason: "Only 8 channels, need ADS1299 for full 8-ch differential"
    - mpn: "STM32F4"
      reason: "Insufficient processing power for real-time DSP"
